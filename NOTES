Make sure you install the dependencies in requirements.txt. You can do this by opening a terminal in your local copy of this repository, and running the following commands. Using a virtual environment is good practice, but you can skip these steps if you wish.

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Setup
Create a file named secrets.json in the same directory as main.py. This file should consist of a JSON array containing your registered email and password. For example, if your email address was "user@example.com" and your password was "hunter2", the contents of the file would be:

["user@example.com", "hunter2"]

python main.py --trust
